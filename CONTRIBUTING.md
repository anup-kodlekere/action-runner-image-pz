### Commit Messages

__All commit messages must include a Sign-off line__

Please consider out commit message standards in order for your contribution to be merged into the main branch.

#### Subject Line
* __Conciseness__: Limit the subject line to around 50 characters to ensure readability in various Git tools.
* __Imperative Mood__: Use the imperative mood, as if giving a command. For example, "Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug."
* __Capitalization__: Capitalize the first letter of the subject line.
* __No Period__: Do not end the subject line with a period.
* __Clarity__: Summarize the core change or purpose of the commit clearly and directly.

#### Body (Optional but highly recommended)
* __Separate from Subject__: Leave a blank line between the subject line and the body.
* __Explain "What" and "Why"__: Detail what changes were made and, more importantly, why those changes were necessary. Focus on the problem solved or the feature implemented, rather than the specific implementation details (the "how").
* __Wrap Lines__: Wrap body lines at approximately 72 characters for better readability.
* __Provide Context__: Include any relevant context, such as links to issues, bug reports, or design documents, if applicable.
* __Explain Side Effects__: Note any potential side effects or non-obvious consequences of the changes.
