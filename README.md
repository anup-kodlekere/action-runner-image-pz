# GitHub Action Runner Image for IBM Power (ppc64le) and IBM Z (s390x)

Github Actions LXD Image Builder

Formerly known as GapLib, this repo is a robust collection of setup scripts for configuring custom GitHub Actions runners. These scripts are designed to seamlessly adapt to updates in `actions/runner`, ensuring compatibility and optimal performance across diverse environments, including **VM (host machine)** , **LXD Containers**, **LXD VMs**, **Docker**, and **Podman**.

This repository also includes source code to create VM images for GitHub-hosted runners widely used in Actions workflows. This image supports multiple operating systems and architectures, providing a versatile and scalable solution to meet diverse project requirements.

## **Overview**

### **Supported Environments**

This runner image supports multiple environments on IBM hardware for a seamless runner setup:

- **VM (host machine)** : Direct setup on virtual or host machines.
- **LXD Container**: Lightweight, system container-based virtualization.
- **LXD VM**: Full virtual machines managed via LXD for enhanced isolation.
- **Docker**: Industry-standard containerization platform.
- **Podman**: Docker-compatible, daemonless container management.

### **Supported Architectures**

- **ppc64le**
- **s390x**
- **x86_64**

### **Supported Operating Systems**

- **Ubuntu**: Versions 22.04, and 24.04.
- **CentOS**: Version 9.

---

## **Scripts**

### **run.sh**

`run.sh` is the primary script for setting up GitHub Actions runners. It provides an interactive, menu-driven interface for selecting environments, operating systems, versions, and setup types.

### **Key Features**

- **Interactive Menu**: Guides users through setup options (VM, LXD Container, LXD VM, Docker, or Podman).
- **Architecture Detection**: Ensures compatibility with supported architectures.
- **Custom OS and Version Selection**: Allows users to tailor setup to specific environments.
- **Setup Type Options**: Supports **Minimal** (basic setup) and **Complete** (full setup) configurations.

---

## **Usage**

1. Clone the repository
    
    
2. Execute the setup script:
    
    ```bash
    bash run.sh
    
    ```
    
3. Follow the prompts to:
    - Select your environment (**VM**, **LXD Container**, **LXD VM**, **Docker**, or **Podman**).
    - Choose your OS and version.
    - Specify the setup type (**Minimal** or **Complete**).

## **Upgrading Runner Binary (VM/Host Machine)**

**This upgrade feature is specifically designed for VM (host machine) setups.** For container-based or LXD-based deployments, please rebuild the image instead.

If you need to upgrade the GitHub Actions runner binary to the latest version on your VM or host machine, simply rerun the setup script:

```bash
bash run.sh
```

The script will automatically:
- Detect the existing runner installation on the host
- Download and install the latest runner binary
- Fix any configuration issues
- Preserve your existing runner registration and settings

**Note**: For VM (host machine) setups, snap and LXD installation are disabled by default to avoid conflicts. The upgrade process will maintain this configuration.

---

## **Setup Options**

### **Main Menu**

The script provides the following main options:
```
1) VM (host machine)
2) LXD Container
3) LXD VM
4) Docker
5) Podman
6) Exit
```

Select an option to proceed with the setup.

### **OS and Version Selection**

Choose your preferred operating system and version (Ubuntu or CentOS). If a version is not specified, the script will prompt you for a selection.

### **Minimal or Complete Setup**

- **Minimal Setup**: Installs only the essential components.
- **Complete Setup**: Performs a full installation with additional configurations.

### **Unsupported Architectures**

If the script encounters an unsupported architecture, it will provide these options:

```
1. Return to the previous step
2. Exit

```

---

## **Requirements**

- **Bash Shell**: Required to execute the scripts.
- **Sudo Privileges**: Necessary for certain setup tasks depending on the chosen environment.
